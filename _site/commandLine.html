<h1 style="text-align: center;">Day One With The Black Screen..</h1><br/>
Every now and then one hears that full stack programmers are the need of the hour. Being one of them, ie one who can code and maintain and entire system form the UI to the database and servers is my dream, and I took my first small step to achieve this big goal today.<br />
Having&nbsp;coded extensively&nbsp;on ruby on rails&nbsp;using the&nbsp;Netbeans tools , for around 2 years, today was my 'Day One' as I would like to call it, with the Black And Green Unix terminal Interface.<br />
Admist loads of learning&nbsp;files , I picked up basic commands to practise and master.&nbsp;Being one who is used to clicking around to navigate&nbsp;through folders, it was an interesting task to practise <br />
-'cd' for navigating directories,<br />
-'mkdir' to create files,<br />
-'ls' commands to list files&nbsp;,<br />
-'cp' to copy files<br />
-'mv' to move or rename files,<br />
-'less' to read through a file,<br />
-'grep' to find files,<br />
-&nbsp;'rm' commands to delete , rather than a right click delete that&nbsp;I&nbsp;have been so used to.<br />
I think today is my first day in the industry as a developer&nbsp;where&nbsp;I&nbsp;can on my finger tips count the number of times&nbsp;I clicked the mouse!! I guess that is the beauty of this language and is something which is different&nbsp;and definitely builds on your excitement to get involved and learn this further.<br />
I must confess that reading up command line&nbsp;and implementing them are two very different and challenging scenario, as this is a strongly typed language.One tends to miss out on finer syntaxes like the position of '*' and '.' s.&nbsp;&nbsp;etc<br />
I&nbsp;personally found the cheatcode chit idea very intresting and helpful&nbsp;as after a brief practise when you get invovled in carring out a series of operations&nbsp;,&nbsp;you tend to get stuck up with syntactical errors. A cheatcode&nbsp;then&nbsp;helps you brush up your command syntax's. I have mentioned the link to the cheat sheet which I found helpful.<br />

<br />
I would suggest that taking up a small quiz as a self analysis is a big confidence booster. I tried the following link.<br />
