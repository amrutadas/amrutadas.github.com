	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Relooking HTML : A Designers Perspective..</h1><br/>
<br />
From A Developer For once I branched on and tried to understand HTML from a designers view!!<br />
<br />
Many of us have used HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) extensively, for creating User Interface for our our web apps and stand websites.<br />
But for once I got the&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to sit back and pondered on why we use it!<br />
What is the base from which we should start building?<br />
All of us build pages... But are we going it the right way? Do we have our priorities set straight?<br />
Do we understand the tags we are using? Are there some practises which we should be adhered by to enhance our user's experience ?<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaLMY2daQwo/T04s2T0AiBI/AAAAAAAAADk/jLA8DyaTjIE/s1600/why_me.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="148" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaLMY2daQwo/T04s2T0AiBI/AAAAAAAAADk/jLA8DyaTjIE/s200/why_me.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>
And the Comes The EPIC OLD QUESTION~ Why Do Developers need to&nbsp;wrack&nbsp;their&nbsp;brains over design????<br />
<br />
&nbsp;To answer my own queries I read up and I want to share my understanding, hoping that it may help you....<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Well&nbsp;whether&nbsp;&nbsp;a designer or developer, the end goal is to create a spectacular user experience.The user dose not care about who created the database&nbsp;or who wrote the title page. We need to understand that all they want is a easily usable interface.<br />
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-97mcQCSfE_M/T04tR7bUd1I/AAAAAAAAADs/jmvvbwdZ6Us/s1600/caughtin+impediment.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="132" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-97mcQCSfE_M/T04tR7bUd1I/AAAAAAAAADs/jmvvbwdZ6Us/s200/caughtin+impediment.jpg" width="200" /></a>&nbsp;Besides that many a times we face issues in our firms, wherein designer is not&nbsp;available&nbsp;or is busy in other errands. These impediments delay our work.<br />
So developers time to get self sufficient!! No more waiting and head banging over nearing deadline....It is not rocket&nbsp;science&nbsp;and practise does make everything perfect! Try it, it does accelerate your creativity!<br />
<br />
<br />
I started with a basic understanding between the difference between STATIC and DYNAMIC HTML ? And which is better ?<br />
<br />
- &nbsp;Static HTML: It is used to&nbsp;create&nbsp;web site or web app UI page content that doesn't change and stays the same on every page view by a user<br />
- &nbsp;Dynamic HTML (DHTML) : Is created when we make our web pages "do stuff" i.e. create an Interactive web page, which<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;is nothing but a combination of technologies used together to create interactive and animated web sites by using a combination of a static markup language(such as HTML),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;a client-side scripting language(such as Java Script), a presentation definition language (such as CSS), and the Document Object Model.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;If one argues about which is better, then you are heading towards a deadlock!<br />
Static pages are&nbsp;undoubtedly&nbsp;lighter, thus easier to render and maintain,as they are not prone to<br />
changes. But the choice of page depends on the purpose of creation. If you want to simply render content &nbsp; i.e. design a manual or list requirements&nbsp;for admission in a college, then one should design static pages.<br />
But when you want to design a website for a shopping mall or a bank etc, then it has to be interactive.Just rendering content will not meet your purpose.Thus dynamic pages is then the need of the hour.<br />
To summarise it up, it is based on your requirement that you take a call on&nbsp;whether&nbsp;you want to create a static page or add dynamic elements to it.<br />
<br />
Then again we get he hear about the tug of war of <b>Structure Vs Presentation</b>. Do we know what exactly we are talking about?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1f6nvzTjd7E/T0449lo1XSI/AAAAAAAAAEE/7-edmpZK4eo/s1600/structure.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="171" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1f6nvzTjd7E/T0449lo1XSI/AAAAAAAAAEE/7-edmpZK4eo/s200/structure.jpg" width="200" /></a>- Structure is the basic content for which you have designed your web page.Your HTML holds in your content.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXuoIrFVPDY/T045FgNzEmI/AAAAAAAAAEM/JJXsIQ7TLNE/s1600/presentation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="195" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXuoIrFVPDY/T045FgNzEmI/AAAAAAAAAEM/JJXsIQ7TLNE/s200/presentation.jpg" width="200" /></a>- &nbsp;CSS only provides your content’s visual presentation.<br />
Our HTML page should be such constructed, so that even if the presentation(i.e. the CSS) is removed,you still have an interactive working page, rendering all the content and carrying out all the tasks it was suppose to.<br />
Thus to separate Content(Structure) from Presentation is the thumb rule.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Some&nbsp;<b>Good&nbsp;Practices</b>&nbsp;One Must try to follow while <b>Coding</b>:<br />
- Add sensible and relevant comments to your code. This make your code more understandable and easier to maintain.Avoid Excess comments.<br />
- Always declare Doctype.It tells the browsers of the XHTML standards.<br />
- Use meaning full tag names.It helps make a web page more meaningful and search-engine friendly.<br />
- Use Divs to Divide Your Layout into Major Sections.It promotes clean and well-indented code.<br />
&nbsp; It will also help you avoid confusion and excess use of divs, especially if you are writing complex and lengthy markup.<br />
- Don’t use inline styles in your HTML. Always create a separate CSS file for your styles.<br />
- As discussed above,&nbsp;segregate&nbsp;the content and presentation.<br />
- Use Heading Elements Wisely:For eg. Don't define a class overriding attributes of h6 header.Learn to use &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; elements to denote your HTML’s content hierarchy. <br />
- Use the Right HTML Element at the Right Place- Avoid unnecessary overlapping of unused div's. Understand the structure and then start.<br />
- Use an Unordered List (&lt;ul&gt;) for Navigation<br />
- Close Your Tags - Unclosed tags are compatible with some browsers and render correct, but are not compatible with many other browsers.<br />
- Use Lower Case Markup:&nbsp;Using&nbsp;upper case will render well, but lower case mark up enhances&nbsp;readability.<br />
- Write Consistently Formatted Code.<br />
- Validate Your Code using services such as the free W3C markup validation service can be a useful debugger that helps you identify rendering errors.<br />
<br />
<b>What do you mean by a Design</b>?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Is it blindly just matching customer requirements and some how putting stuff in place???????<br />
&nbsp;Web Design and HTML are all about creating a great Web site. We use Web development and Web site &nbsp;design to build Web sites that provide customers a&nbsp;great UI experience which enable them to access all services they requested for or get all the content they desire.<br />
But that is not all. Design is also about ensuring that the right content sits in the correct place and all the desired features are presented at its best.<br />
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u8Dg8Wvyv_s/T042ZiZ1SJI/AAAAAAAAAD8/7LFapN1eZW0/s1600/design.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u8Dg8Wvyv_s/T042ZiZ1SJI/AAAAAAAAAD8/7LFapN1eZW0/s1600/design.jpg" /></a>Further it is also about ensuring that the page has been coded with zero&nbsp;redundant&nbsp;tags and data to be conveyed is structured and&nbsp;prioritized.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some&nbsp;<b>Good&nbsp;Practices</b>&nbsp;One Must try to follow while<b>&nbsp;Designing:</b><br />
- The goal of the page , i.e. the important contents, should be very easy to locate. You can make it bold or add a striking&nbsp;color or&nbsp;align&nbsp;it such that its the first feature that strikes the user&nbsp;.<br />
&nbsp;Ultimately in one glance the user should be able to easily find the&nbsp;message&nbsp;the page is designed to convey.<br />
- Your colour choices, fonts and positioning should be in sync with one's natural instincts.<br />
&nbsp; For eg: Usually our brain puts the first element it reads as the highest priority.So the crux of your message should me bold and clear.<br />
- Depending on purpose the subsequent topics, based on&nbsp;their&nbsp;priority, should be designed in a logically consistent way. <br />
- Group related content and visuals together to help the user quickly find the information he needs.<br />
- The grouping should be logical and clear.One should see and understand which elements are grouped and why they are grouped.<br />
- Choose the perfect way to&nbsp;align&nbsp;your content. Choose an alignment&nbsp;which suites your purpose. It may be traditional i.e. left&nbsp;aligned or right aligned etc, or may be in a column fashion. Usually center&nbsp;aligned&nbsp;it not&nbsp;preferred. Basically depending on your content and making sure that the page has a balanced&nbsp;pleasant&nbsp;look, you can choose any alignment that suits you.<br />
- Avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;minor&nbsp;misalignment,&nbsp;adding extra&nbsp;content&nbsp;and other visual flotsam in order to convey information that's already conveyed.<br />
<br />
Remember Irrespective of your direction of effort.... Your Ultimate Goal is a HAPPY CUSTOMER &nbsp;:-)<br />
