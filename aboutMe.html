<b>Welcome To My "Den"</b><br />
<br />
I am a Developer and have been coding&nbsp;&nbsp;for a little over 2.5 years now.<br />
I work for one of the finest firm in providing IT Solutions Globally- "Tata&nbsp;Consultancy&nbsp;Services"<br />
<br />
My key technology is Ruby and as can decipher from my Tech Blogs, I have been running my fingers over various aspects of web app development recently . The whole Idea of learning new stuff that spans across the life span of an app i.e. Right from the User Interface to the Database tables and servers, is the call for the day or rather is what is frequently&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to as "The Full Stack Developer".<br />
<br />
It feels Great to&nbsp;realize&nbsp;the efficiency and&nbsp;Independence&nbsp;a coder feels, when you can design, code and deploy on your own !!! <br />
<br />
On a more lighter note I am person who believes in &nbsp;"Fun At Work", as the ultimate Mantra for Success.<br />

<br />
<br />
I take part in several CSR (Corporate Social&nbsp;Responsibilities) programs, which ranges from teaching slum kids to&nbsp;organizing&nbsp;trips and camps.<br />
I am a Guide and have been awarded with "Governor&nbsp;Award"&nbsp;, for my performance &nbsp;as a Guide.<br />
<br />
The whole Idea of helping people, arranging camps, long&nbsp;treks&nbsp;fills in a gush of&nbsp;fresh&nbsp;spirit and air in me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In my free hour, I &nbsp;love writing on abstract stuff. Dreamer, that I am , I enjoy write about things and moments around me which touched my heart or left behind trail of remembrance. I have written down some of my Dreamy lines for you. Hope it brings a smile in your lips as it does to mine. For me reading my stuff is like a trip &nbsp;"Down The Memory Lane".<br />
<br />
<b>Hope you enjoy the reading experience ! </b><br />
